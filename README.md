## 🧩 What is Coinllery?

Coinllery is a space for **decentralized curation** and **onchain personal expression**. Users can build their own digital galleries using real-time data from Zora Coins — telling stories through the tokens they connect with and care about.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📡 Powered by the **Zora Coins SDK**, with live metadata (title, image, creator, mint info, etc.)
- 🖼 Tools to build and share **personalized coin galleries**
- 📨 **Wallet or email login** via Privy for broader accessibility
- 🔁 Real-time feeds and featured galleries to encourage discovery
- 💬 Clean, user-friendly interface for both collectors and casual users

## 💭 Vision

We believe **curation is culture**.

Our goal is to make Coinllery a lightweight, expressive way to showcase, organize, and engage with onchain media — from personal displays to physical installations and community exhibitions.

As creators from the periphery of Brazil, this project also represents reclaiming digital space using tools that are accessible, creative, and community-driven.

## 🔮 What’s Next?

Post-hackathon, we aim to:

- 📱 Develop Coinllery as a cross-platform app (TV, mobile, tablets)
- 🏠 Turn any screen into a personal onchain gallery
- 📊 Roll out new features based on community usage and feedback
- 🔗 Keep evolving with the Zora protocol and ecosystem
